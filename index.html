It consists of 176 islands and is divided into three main groups: Tongatapu in the south, Vava’u in the north, and Ha’apai in the centre. Tonga is the last kingdom in the Pacific Ocean and is one of the oldest continuous monarchies in the world. Currently, the King of Tonga is Tupou VI, and his son, Tupoutoʻa ʻUlukalala, is next in line for the throne.</p>

<h1>Cultural </h1>
  <p> Tongan society is guided by four core values that work together to provide a warm welcome to visitors to the Kingdom. These values are mutual respect (Fefaka’apa’apa’aki), sharing, cooperation and fulfilment of mutual obligations (Feveitokai’aki), humility and generosity (Lototoo), and loyalty and commitment (Tauhi vaha’a). </p>
<p> In Tongan culture, family plays a central role. Older people are highly respected, and each family member has a defined role. A typical Tongan family may include adopted children, cousins, distant relatives, siblings, and grandparents. This emphasis on family reflects the people’s love and reverence for the Tongan Royal Family. </p>
<p> Weddings and funerals are the two most significant events in Tongan family life. During these occasions, traditional tapa cloths and woven mats are gifted. Despite modernization, many Tongans still live in villages, and traditional village life has remained largely unchanged. The people of Tonga continue to embrace traditional practices, making it one of the most authentic travel destinations in the South Pacific. </p>

<h3> Traditional Tongan Food </h3>
<p> Traditional Tongan food is deeply rooted in the island's cultural customs and history. It has been shaped by generations of native cooking methods and the accessibility of goods obtained locally. Tongan meals depend heavily on fresh, locally obtained seafood, meats, and produce. </p>
<p> One of the traditional cooking methods used in Tonga is the 'umu, or underground oven. This ancient method involves digging a pit in the ground, lining it with hot stones, and layering it with food such as meats, root vegetables (like taro and yams), and parcels wrapped in coconut cream. The food is then covered with leaves and left to cook slowly over several hours. This results in tender, flavorful dishes infused with the natural smokiness of the earth. </p>
<p> Coconut, a staple ingredient in Tongan cuisine, is used in various forms including coconut cream, coconut milk, and grated coconut flesh. It adds richness and depth to many dishes and is often combined with other ingredients, such as taro leaves, fish, and root vegetables, to create flavorful stews and curries. </p>
<p> Seafood plays a prominent role in Tongan cuisine. Fresh fish, octopus, and shellfish are readily available and widely consumed. Raw fish dishes, such as 'ota 'ika (marinated raw fish in lemon juice and coconut milk), are popular and showcase the abundance of seafood on the island. </p>
<p> Traditional Tongan dishes also feature root vegetables like taro, yams, and cassava. These versatile ingredients are used in soups, stews, and side dishes. Taro, yams, and cassava are hearty and nutritious staples that have sustained the Tongan people for generations and remain an essential part of their diet. </p>
<p> Traditional Tongan foods that you must try are 'ota 'ika (raw fish with lemon and coconut cream) and lu pulu (corned beef and coconut milk wrapped in taro leaves). When it comes to drinks, the most popular option is Otai, which is a fruit drink. The two most popular flavours of Otai are watermelon, pineapple, and coconut, and mango with apples and coconut, but there are many other flavours available as well. </p>

  <h3> Traditional Tongan Tapa Making  </h3>
  <p>Tongan tapa making is a traditional process that involves beating strips of mulberry tree bark into a thin and smooth cloth. The cloth is then decorated with intricate patterns using natural dyes or stamps carved from coconut shells. The resulting tapa cloth is used for various ceremonial and cultural purposes, such as clothing, wall hangings, and gifts. This cloth holds significant cultural value as it represents Tongan identity and craftsmanship. </p>
<p>Tapa is an important aspect of Tongan culture. It represents and expresses Tongan heritage, social status, and spiritual beliefs. It symbolises a connection to tradition and is often exchanged as gifts during important ceremonies such as weddings and funerals. Tapa plays a central role in preserving and passing down Tongan customs from one generation to the next.</p>
